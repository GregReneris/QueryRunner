# QueryRunner


QueryRunner is a program I modified and expanded upon based on source files from my database course.

The purpose of the project was to create a GUI that functioned with an existing database that my team had designed.

The second half of the project was to create a command line interface version of
the program. The command line interactions run with a variety of loops and if statements to create a straightforward interface fo the user.

QueryRunner was inspired by class 5021 at Seattle U.
